A network dissector is a protocol decoder. It is the implementation of some understanding of a given protocol to allow the extraction of specific information from its messages. For example, an FTP dissector applied to a certain traffic should understand the messages related to this protocol. With the dissector implemented correctly, it would be possible to extract even a file transferred via FTP during a connection.

This task's goal is for the group to develop an HTTP dissector allowing reassembly (extracting) the files transferred during sessions of the protocol. In addition to the dissector, each group must write a brief report describing the implementation and decisions taken during the development and testing phases.
